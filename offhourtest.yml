    The policy will apply only to those EC2 instances that are 
    atleast 1 hours old and include the tag "c7n_off_hours". Tag 
    your EC2 instance with Key "c7n_off_hours" for Custodian to 
    consider it in scope for action. Value can be anything. 
    Custodian just look for "Key" to consider it into the scope for 
    offhours. Stop EC2 instances as per schedule in c7n_off_hours 
    that is 0 UTC = 6PM CST.
